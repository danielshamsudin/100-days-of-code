# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: June 22, 2022

**Today's Progress**: -

**Thoughts:** Just discovered 100 Days of Code, going to start working on a React/Firebase project tomorrow. 

### Day 1: June 23, 2022
**Today's Progress**: 
- Changed date from item date to current operation date
- Added conditional button text display w.r.t the quantity of the item
- Added withdraw UI, and logic check on the quantity of the item

**Thoughts**: -

### Day 2: June 24, 2022
**Today's Progress**: 
- Added Model and view for the withdraw UI
- Added update and delete logic (firebase) 

**Thoughts**: The code base still needs some cleaning, but it's working. Still need to do some proper testing. Client requested for the site to be hosted somewhere, might try on gh-pages tomorrow. 

### Day 3: June 25, 2022
**Today's Progress**: 
- Changed navbar to responsive on mobile devices
- Hosted page on Netlify

**Thoughts**: Hosted the page on netlify, totally a new experience on using it. Had a problem on deploying straight from git, but manually deploying it when running `npm run build` works. Will experiment on deploying from git next time. 

### Day 4: June 26, 2022
**Today's Progress**: 
- Successfully deployed the site on netlify with git CI
- Added authentication, login page, register page
- Added new navbar for when user is logged in and default navbar for when user is not logged in

**Thoughts**: Finally deployed the page on netlify with CI. It's a new experience on using it. Though a little bit of setup was needed. I need to change the netlify build command to `CI npm run build` for it to work.
